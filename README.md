# âš½PremStats - Premier League StatFinder

**PremStats** is a Java-based Spring Boot application backed by PostgreSQL, designed to give football analysts, fans, and developers rich access to Premier League player and team statistics. The system ingests real-time-esque scraped data via a Python scraping pipeline, normalizes it into CSV, and persists it for fast, filterable querying.

Users can explore in-depth metrics including goals, assists, expected goals (xG), expected assists (xA), disciplinary data, playing time, and moreâ€”filtered by attributes like nationality, age, position, and team.
